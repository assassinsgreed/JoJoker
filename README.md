# JoJoker (In Beta!)

A balatro mod that provides JoJo's Bizarre Adventure themed jokers, consumables, and more!

This mod emphasizes fun and creativity first and foremost, with balance coming afterward.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have installed the latest release of both [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded)
2. Download the desired release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/assassinsgreed/JoJoker/releases). If you want the latest, unreleased changes, download from the [latest commit](https://github.com/assassinsgreed/JoJoker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Download the code and put it into your `Mods` folder
   1. This should look like `./Mods/JoJoker-1.0.0` if you took a release, with the specific version depending on the release chosen
   2. This should look like `./Mods/JoJoker-main` if you took the latest commit
4. Unzip the contents. You may delete the zip archive afterward
5. Make sure there is only one JoJoker in the folder structure. For example, if you pulled the latest release...
   1. `./Mods/JoJoker-main` is correct
   2. `./Modes/JoJoker/JoJoker-main` is incorrect
6. Start the game, configure JoJoker in the mods section, and have fun!
